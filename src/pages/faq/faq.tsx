                Ease of Experience: The payment process is very simple. It is
                very easy to raise a fund or donate. Money being generated
                against a cause or campaign can be viewed on a real-time basis.
                Due to payment through bank card, every transaction can be
                traced back to the donor, minimizing any chance of ‘black money’
                or money from ‘illegal and criminal activities’ hitting being
                channeled through this system.

                <strong>Trust and Credibility:</strong> The projects are either
                by established and renowned organization or individuals with
                credibility. Cholo Shobai applies an internal due-diligence
                whereby the background of each individual or organization
                willing to raise fund is checked and verified.
                <br />
                <br />
                <strong>Acknowledgement:</strong> Each donor will receive an
                acknowledgement for their contribution, and an update on their
                chosen initiative every month till the campaign runs.

                <p className={classes.bodyTxt}>
                  The first step is submitting your campaign details through
                  this page and then contact us through email or our Facebook
                  Page. If we think your cause fits with our objective, we will
                  ask for additional information. See the list of{" "}
                  <strong>required documents.</strong>
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  Within maximum 72 hours, our team will make a decision. If you
                  fulfill all criteria, your campaign will be live in our websit

                <p className={classes.bodyTxt}>
                  We want to onboard causes or initiatives that work for the
                  well being or safety of a community (like equipment for
                  nurses) or respond to a national crisis (like COVID-19) or
                  support a very localized problem (like safe-drinking for slum
                  dwellers in old Dhaka) or create a mechanism to increase
                  income or livelihood of a group of people (like a project for
                  buying farmers’ produce from Jashore). We are also open to
                  causes that touch SDG goals.

                <p className={classes.bodyTxt}>
                  The advantage of an online platform is that the money raised
                  for your cause or your organization can all be tracked
                  digitally. You will be able to track total money raised on a
                  real-time basis.

                  WHAT WILL BE THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE CAMPAIGN PARTNER?
                </h3>
                <p className={classes.bodyTxt}>
                  There are some requirements in the beginning while onboarding
                  with us, mostly documents. You are expected to submit soft
                  copies of these documents at an earliest. Once the funds are
                  being raised, it is mandatory for the partners to provide a
                  few photos, and output of the initiatives, mostly through
                  numbers. If the campaign generates more than 75% of your
                  target, we may want to bring some of your donors for a look at
                  the initiative a few weeks/months after the initiative starts.

                <p className={classes.bodyTxt}>
                  There is a 3% charge for using payment gateway on all
                  donations. There will be a registration fee and other weekly
                  charges going forward, but for now, there’s no cost involved
                  for all Corona related campaigns except for payment gateway
                  charges.

                  Yes, you can. But you must provide information that
                  demonstrates your credibility and previous experience to our
